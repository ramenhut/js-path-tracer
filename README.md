## JavaScript Path Tracer
This is a reduced and non-real-time port of Final Stage, my real-time GPU accelerated path tracer, to HTML5 using JavaScript and the canvas element. 
This version supports most of the same visual features, but lacks support for shaders and the visual memory management system that 
are present in Final Stage. For more information about Final Stage, check out its [project page](http://bertolami.com/index.php?engine=portfolio&content=graphics&detail=real-time-path-tracer).
